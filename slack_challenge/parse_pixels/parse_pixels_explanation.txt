We are going to be using the module "Image" from the library PIL / python imaging library.

Firstly we get a handle to the image.

Then we get the pixels by using the "load()" function; which is just the last x and y of the image for each axis.

Then we loop through each of the pixel by incrementing y on each time the loop get executed, then setting y back to 0 and incrementing x by 1 when the y is out of bounds
